  <h2>Welcome to MicroFrontEnd  </h2>
  <p>
    Micro-frontend architecture is a design approach in which a front-end app is decomposed into individual, semi-independent “microapps” working loosely together. The micro-frontend concept is vaguely inspired by, and named after, microservices.
    Independent development teams can collaborate on a front-end app more easily.</p>
